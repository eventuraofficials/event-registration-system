# 🧠 CLAUDE DEEP FIX COMMAND

## 🔧 Objective
Perform a **full deep repair** and optimization of this project.

---

## 🩺 Step 1 – System-wide Error Diagnosis
- Identify **all** build, runtime, and logic errors across frontend and backend.
- Analyze dependency issues, broken imports, unused variables, missing files, and incorrect paths.
- Detect inconsistent components, broken routes, and failing API calls.

---

## ⚙️ Step 2 – Automatic Repair
- Fix **every** detected issue without breaking working logic.
- Ensure all pages, functions, and UI components render correctly.
- Validate backend logic, database connections, and API endpoints.
- Resolve all console errors and warnings.
- Remove all temporary, unused, or duplicate code.
- Replace placeholder text, `TODO`, or incomplete logic with final working code.

---

## 🚀 Step 3 – Optimization
- Refactor messy or repetitive code into reusable, readable, modular components.
- Standardize naming conventions, imports, and structure.
- Optimize for performance, loading speed, and responsiveness.
- Ensure consistent UI/UX styling and responsiveness on all screen sizes.
- Confirm app builds successfully with no warnings or errors.

---

## 🧪 Step 4 – Final Verification
- Run a **virtual test simulation** of all key user flows (login, register, navigation, CRUD operations, etc.).
- If errors are detected, fix them automatically.
- Confirm the system can be deployed immediately with no missing dependencies.

---

## 🗒️ Step 5 – Report
After completing the full repair and optimization:
- Summarize all major fixes made.
- Explain any significant changes in logic or structure.
- Confirm that the project now runs smoothly without manual debugging.

---

> 🧭 **Goal:** After this process, the website should be fully functional, stable, optimized, and ready for production — with zero console or runtime errors.
